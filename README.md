# Spark API ðŸŽ‡
The dead-simple GraphQL API of inspirational quotes.

[Try It Here](https://spark-api-graphql.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
Use this API like you would any other GraphQL API.
Apollo has a [great article](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/4-simple-ways-to-call-a-graphql-api-a6807bcdb355/) on this.

### Example Queries
Get all quotes with the quote itself, author, and category
```
query{
  quotes{
    body
    author
    category{
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Get a random quote with the body, author, category and author type.
```
query{
  randomQuote{
    body
    author
    authorType
    category{
      name
    }
  }
}
```

An example response would look like this:
```
{
  "data": {
    "randomQuote": {
      "body": "Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.",
      "author": "Benjamin Franklin",
      "authorType": "Political Figure",
      "category": [
        {
          "name": "Learning"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Why?
There aren't enough APIs in the world with inspirational quotes out there for developers to use in their applications. While I started learning and playing with GraphQL, I decided this would be a fun one to build.

The Spark API is intended to spark end users with delight and inspiration.

### Project Status
I started this project as a learning exercise - which is why it's so nascent. For this reason, I'm using the free version of the Heroku app. If people are interested and usage of the API grows, I'll consider adding more!
